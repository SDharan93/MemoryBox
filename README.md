# Memory Box

An Android app that will that allow young onset individuals in early stages of dementia to log and retrieve memories. The application records the voice initiated memory log made by the user and stores it into a cloud based server. When the user requests the memory log using a key word, the application will repeat the latest stored memory containing the key word back to the user. A web portal was  created to list all the memory logs made by the user, and show the most frequenty searched key word and the most stored phrase.

The application was build during a hackathon, as such the code is messy and may be fixed later. The application currently will not work as the server used for memory storage and retrival is currently not running.
